## ðŸ”§ What is a Jenkins Pipeline?

A **Jenkins Pipeline** is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.

A pipeline defines the entire lifecycle of your CI/CD process as code. You write this code in a `Jenkinsfile` that lives in your source code repository.
